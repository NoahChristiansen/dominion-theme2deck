# Dominion Themed Deck Maker (theme2deck)

Just a fun side project using word2vec and Streamlit to make an app for building themed Dominion games.

You can use the app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/noahchristiansen/dominion-theme2deck/main/theme2deck.py).


To use, start by selecting a `word2vec` model, then enter a one-word theme as well as the number of cards you would like to see (minimum is 5).
